Fishing:

16m 30s - Research and configuration for fish weights, for different types of baits.
1h 20m - Creating, configuring and setting up Lua classes.
41m - Fishing rod creation and placement configuration.
1h 47m - Boat rental coding, testing and optimization
12m - Return rental marker configuration
5m - Rental blips & multi location support.
35m - Algorithm Programming
32m 44s - Zones setup and logic
2h 2m - Item uses, quantity checks (callbacks), and entire fishing core logic
1h 35m - Fish black market selling (includes synced NPC ped, animations with ped and yourself upon deal completion, dist checks for the deals)
42m - Fish sales (menu, markers, client and server logic, configuration files)
2m - Progress bar (waiting for fish to bite)
5m - Make using the bait start fishing, however you still require a fishing rod in your inventory
20m - Fishing logic (medium), creating fish meat items
10m - Small fish (land fishing) logic
10m - If you use small fish bait in a deep fishing location, you will only receive a land fishing fish. 
12m - Zone fishing logic, added logic so you can't catch a rare zone fish if you're using medium or small bait in a rare zone, you'll only catch either a medium or small fish.
56m - Heavy fish tug boat attachment logic and configuration
1h 10m - Fish spawning logic, behaviour and swimming controller, testing and debugging.
40m - Fish max logic and recode of server fish determining code to make it more optimized, faster and cleaner.
1h 55m - Rare fish (dolphin, shark, whale) mini game design, logic, syncing and fish attachments onto the boat when you catch it with your crew.
10m - Rotated fish on back of tug to be on stomach, not on it's side.
2m - Fish on boat is still created if you don't have enough crew men, so had to implement a check much earlier on in the minigame.
